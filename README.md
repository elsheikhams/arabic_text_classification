# arabic_text_classification
A multi-class text classification model that predicts Arabic dialects given a text. Both machine learning models and deep learning architectures were used in this project.
The highest accuarcy was achieved by using LinearSVC() classifier in the case of the machine learning models. The deep learning model, on the other hand, achieved less validation accuarcy. The deep learning architecture used in this classification problem was LSTM, with 3 epochs.
